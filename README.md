## Pilot UT


### Purpose of Usability Testing (UT):

The purpose of UT is to uncover any issues with the developmental and design process of the website. UT uses a small sample size that requires the participants to do a detailed test in order for the testers to collect empirical data. These tests are very controlled and can be done in a location or remotely. The participants will come from different backgrounds and they are usually asked to perform realistic tasks while using the product. As a result, UT is able to uncover more global usability problems. The goal of usability testing is to inform the design, eliminate frustration, and improve profitability. 


### Pilot UT Introduction:

Craigslist is a popular online website where people can post jobs, services, items, housing, resumes, and discussion forums. This site mainly connects people from the same area, but can also connect people across the world. Craigslist is mainly known for buying and selling items and services, allowing users to purchase used items for much lower prices than retail. Therefore, the pilot UT will test the functions of their site to determine the usability of craigslistâ€™s website. 

During my heuristic evaluation of this website, I found several pressing issues within the website. 

- **Poor categorization of item identification**, making it difficult to find and differentiate different items. 

- The system is **unable to prevent, recognize, diagnose, and recover** from entering invalid inputs in the filtering toolbar. 

 - The site is inefficient to use due to the cluttering of information and has **poor functional and aesthetic design**.


### Methodology:

This test will be conducted in a quiet area within my home and a laptop. The laptop will be simultaneously recording the screen as well as the participant's face expressions throughout the test. The moderator will be sitting a seat length away from the participant to answer any questions or troubleshoot any issues they may have.

The process of the test will begin with the moderator introducing the pilot UT and the reason why a test like this must be done. The participants will then be asked to sign the form if they agree to the terms of this test. Then, participants will be asked several pretest questions to determine their initial thoughts on the site. Next, they will be asked to perform three realistic tasks to determine the usability and functions of the site. During these tasks, they will be asked to talk about their thought process out loud. Finally, participants will be asked to answer several finishing questions to determine their experience using the craigslist website.

### Reflection:

During this pilot test, I was able to learn more about the process and purpose of UT. By doing the process myself and using a website that I have never used before, I realized that it was important to have good heuristics for a functional website.While creating the survey for the test, I struggled a bit when using the site since I was new to the site. As a result, I spent quite some time understanding the functions in order to create a proper test for the pilot UT. Due to this, I was able to get a better understanding of what needs to be tested. 

During the participant testing, there were many things that went well but there were many things that did not go so well. The particular participant I selected for this test has a quirky personality and found particular things funny during the test, making the atmosphere more lighthearted. He would also ask questions when he was confused about a certain topic or question. However, he was also joking around from time to time which may have also caused the test to be taken less seriously. This also caused the moderator job to be more difficult than I thought it would be. 

Additionally, this participant was extremely familiar with the interface. This made the tasks extremely easy for him to do while I, who was new to the site, struggled a little while performing the same tasks. When asked to explain his thought process, he could not explain very well since he understood and knew where all the site functions were. Due to this, the UT process was done very quickly. As a result, for the future testing, I will need multiple testers with different familiarity levels of the site. The participant found the tasks to be very realistic and possible, so I would like to create a more comprehensive test that tested more functions and abilities of the site.
